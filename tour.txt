#Welcome;<p align="left">This tour illustrates salient features of the study 'Cellular Diversity in Human Subgenual Anterior Cingulate and Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex by Single-Nucleus RNA-sequencing' by Kim et al. The associated GitHub repos can be found here <a href="https://github.com/NIMH-HBCC/HBCC_snRNAseq_sgACC-DLPFC" target="_blank"> (GitHub link)</a>. The data set contains detection of 63,901 cells and 28,195 genes in twenty-five samples (14 DLPFC and 11 sgACC).</p><p align="left"><font color="##FF0000"><strong>NOTE:</strong></font> If the tour is not jumping to the correct UI elements, exit by clicking anywhere else on the app, and click on the top-right question mark to start a new tour.</p>
#ReducedDimensionPlot1;<p align="left"><font color="#402ee8">Reduced dimension plot</font> panels provide an overview of the data in any precomputed reduced dimensions, such as <i>t</i>-SNE, PCA etc.</p><p align="left">Conveniently, any sample metadata or feature assay value may be overlaid as color onto the data points (e.g., cell type).</p>
#FeatureAssayPlot1;<p align="left">The expression of a gene as logcounts or counts across all the braod class cell types can be explored. Also each of the cells can be distinguished by coloring based on the brain region associated with the cells.</p>
#ColumnDataPlot1;<p align="left">The distribution of broad classes ofthe cell types across all 47 clusters of cell types can be easily visualized using a <font color="#402ee8">Column data plot</font> panel.</p>
#ComplexHeatmapPlot1;<p align="left">As a result, the expression of one gene (feature) may be compared to another one.</p>
